actually considered.




Minor bugs
----------


bug 1

"jmp register" can't be interpreted. It can occurs sometimes with
a switch. An error message is printed and propose an other alternative
with the option --dump, which disassemble only.


bug 2

The pefile library seems to be bugged. Sometimes the function 
pe.load_import_symbols fails because the internal function of pefile,
parse_data_directories, throw an exception.
